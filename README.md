Android app for learning IPA and American English pronunciation

This app helps students learn to distinguish the various sounds of American English, which is the first step in being able to produce those sounds. 

Students can learn, practice, and take tests on both individual sounds and double sounds. The double sounds, which consist of a consonant and a vowel, were added to help students differenciate sounds in context.

If you would like to add a translation in your language, then that is also welcome.

If you find any problems, help improve this app by reporting them at www.aepronunciation.com/app/.

Translations into other languages are also welcome.
